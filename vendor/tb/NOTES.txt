# Optimizer crap

  some of the optimizations i should probably worry about are proving when numbers can't
  overflow, like induction vars:

```
for {
    i = phi(0, j)
    // even if n is TOP, i must be at least TOP and
    // after all additions on the PHI... which means
    // no overflow
    if i >= n break
    ...
    // next
    j = i + 1
}
```
