# Sea of Nodes (SoN)

  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/c2-ir95-150110.pdf)

  SoN is an SSA where ordering is relaxed in the form of explicit dependencies
  as opposed to local ordering inside basic blocks, for instance pure operations
  like addition will not have an exact placement only the constraint that it must
  be resolved after it's inputs. This makes it easier to perform local optimizations
  without a care for scheduling, this is especially helpful because of how many
  optimizations we've moved to peepholes.

  note: edges going down from A to B means B is dependent on A.

  note: we're not showing the control edge memory operations have for simplicit but
  both of these are sharing a control edge. Stores produce more memory but don't produce
  more control flow and Loads use memory but don't produce more (these are both non-volatile)
